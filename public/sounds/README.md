# Sound Effects

This directory needs two sound effect files:

1. `hack-success.mp3`: A short (0.3-0.5s) high-pitched digital success sound
   - Recommended: A cyberpunk-style "beep" or "ping" sound
   - Volume should be moderate as it will be played frequently

2. `hack-failed.mp3`: A short (0.2-0.4s) lower-pitched error sound
   - Recommended: A cyberpunk-style "buzz" or "error" sound
   - Volume should be slightly lower than the success sound

You can obtain these sounds from:
1. Free sound effect libraries (e.g., freesound.org)
2. Create them using a synthesizer
3. Purchase them from a sound effect marketplace

Place the files directly in this directory with the exact names specified above.
